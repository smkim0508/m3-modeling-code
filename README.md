# m3-modeling-code
Prediction code for problems during the M3 Modeling Challenge. ML was not used due to the minimal amount of data presented, and hard-coding was mostly used. For the solution to problem 3, I simply made an easily perceptible and user-friendly function to predict the number of remote workers at a given city and year within the databank.
